There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  # Rock Paper Scissors

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  # Decide who does an unpleasant task with a click of the button

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  # Pick from three battle options that can each defeat one other option, and can be defeated by one other option. Your option will be compared to your opponents to see who the winner is!

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  # Often times there exists a task that can be performed equally well by two individuals or groups, however this task may be time consuming, unpleasant or just a low priority. Regardless, it is a task that needs to be done and a fair solution as to who performs it must be agreed upon. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  # This app allows the two parties to come to this agreement regardless of where they are located, as long as both parties have internet. They each simply select one of three options by clicking a button, and this option will be compared to their opponents option. Whichever option has the advantage over the other is the winner. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  # "I was sick of always having to dishes in our house, so I built this app to fairly and easily decide if my wife should do the dishes occassionally. My hands have never felt better, and Rock Paper Scissors can make your life better too!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  # Enter your name. Choose your opponent. Choose your weapon. See who wins.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  # My former roommate and I moved out of our place about a month ago. We were both recently notified that the pullout couch in the basement had to be removed (even though it wasn't ours) or we would not get our security deposit back. So one of us had to pick it up. Thanks to Rock Paper Scissors, I dodged a major bullet! My old roommate had to drive over and take care of that heavy piece of junk.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  # Have a problem you need to settle up with someone? Head here and setlle it in a heartbeat!
